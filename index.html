                company) and the processing of applications should be digitized
                and implemented in accordance with the legal requirements. In
                addition, some steps in the process have been automated in order
                to reduce the workload of clerks and cut processing costs.

                A platform was implemented that retrieves various financial
                market data and creates simple machine learning models to gain
                insights into financial market movements. The basis of the
                analysis is the technical chart analysis, which is based on a
                candlestick chart. It does not matter which financial instrument
                the candlestick chart is based on. All possible financial
                instruments can be analyzed (shares, derivatives, currencies).

                The goal of the project was to gain insight into the impact on

                <b>Brief description:</b><br />
                The project investigated the extent to which the heterogeneity
                of data records stored in log files affects the performance of
                the infrastructure used. To this end, an initial theoretical
                paper was written that addressed how the heterogeneity of data
                can be defined. Based on this knowledge, log files of different
                heterogeneity classes were generated with a self-programmed
                program. These were then processed in an Elastic Stack running
                in a Kubernetes cluster. The core finding of the project is that
                the heterogeneity of the data, probably triggered by the
                compression algorithm used, has a very strong impact on the
                performance of the Kubernetes cluster. Thus, for highly
                heterogeneous data, more processing power is required during
                processing, resulting in higher costs.

                performance and acceptance by its customers. In the course of
                this, the entire personnel and resource planning (vehicles,
                tools) was digitized and automated as far as possible. The work
                performed on the construction sites according to the planning
                can be accepted directly on site via tablets by the client of
                the construction site and transmitted to the accounting office
